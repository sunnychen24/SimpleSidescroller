Puzzle mechanics: The player must eat the apple to gain the ability to jump across the gap by pressing space, but this is not enough to win. The second puzzle mechanic is the player must climb up the ladder and pick up the pear which they will carry with them to the house in order to win.

Note: there is a 1.5 second cool down time on the jump.
